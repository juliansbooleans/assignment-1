# Kobe Forever
<!-- A one sentence description of the project or assignment -->
This is the first website I've ever created. It is a dedication to my child hood idol - the late great Kobe Bean Bryant.

<!-- It is good practice to add an about or summary -->
## About

In many ways, I had to channel my inner 14 year old to put this project together. This was largely due to the fact that my knowledge of html is quite limited and my knowledge of CSS is non-existent.

Regardless, I was able to put this website together. Most importantly, I feel that I have a more hollistic understanding of how full stack web development works.
